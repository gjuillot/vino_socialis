    title: Wine temperature
    introduction:
      introduction: "For each wine there is an ideal tasting temperature:"
      cold: Too cold, the wine can not fully develop its flavors and tannins are stronger.
      hot: Too hot, alcohol is more present, making the wine unbalanced. White wines appear more acidic.
      well: Do not forget the wine warms quickly in the glass, so do not hesitate to serve it with 1¬∞-2¬∞C lower.

      light: Light red wines (Beaujolais, Alsace...)
      middle: Red wines with average structure (Bourgogne, Loire...)
      strong: Strong red wines (Bordeaux, Sud-Ouest...)
      well1: We often talk about <strong>chambering</strong> red wines. Be careful, if it was perfect before, nowadays rooms are often too hot to put the wine at the right temperature.
      well2: The exceptional wines or highly evolved wines deserve to be served 1¬∞-2¬∞C warmer than usual.
